# Webbai — WhatsApp AI Agent for Business

Webbai connects Claude AI to WhatsApp Business API, giving business owners a conversational assistant that handles their WhatsApp communication.

## What Webbai does

- **Send WhatsApp messages** — free-form text or pre-approved templates, to individuals or in bulk
- **Manage your inbox** — read incoming messages, draft replies, send them with one confirmation
- **Automate follow-ups** — multi-step message sequences with delays, keyword auto-replies, lead nurturing flows
- **Daily appointment reminders** — checks Google Calendar every morning and sends personalized reminders to clients
- **Lead management** — import contacts, track lead status, search your contact database
- **Bulk campaigns** — send template messages to hundreds of contacts at once with rate limiting
- **Create templates** — draft and submit WhatsApp message templates for Meta approval

## How it works

Webbai runs as a hosted backend at `webbai.nl` that:
1. Connects to your WhatsApp Business account via Meta Cloud API
2. Stores your contacts, messages, and automations in a secure database
3. Exposes MCP tools that Claude can call to perform actions
4. Receives incoming WhatsApp messages via webhooks and makes them available in your inbox

## Key concepts

### WhatsApp messaging rules
- **First contact**: You MUST use an approved template message. Free-form text is blocked.
- **24-hour window**: After someone messages you, you can reply with free-form text for 24 hours.
- **After 24 hours**: Back to templates only.
- **Templates must be approved by Meta** before they can be used.

### Automations
- **Trigger types**: `new_lead` (when a lead comes in), `inbound_reply` (when someone messages you with a keyword)
- **Multi-step flows**: Chain multiple messages with delays (e.g., welcome → 24h follow-up → 3-day nudge)
- **Flow groups**: Group related automation steps together under a single flow name

### Contacts & leads
- Contacts are stored with name, phone, email, and source
- Leads have a status pipeline: new → contacted → qualified → converted / lost
- Contacts can be imported individually or in bulk via CSV
